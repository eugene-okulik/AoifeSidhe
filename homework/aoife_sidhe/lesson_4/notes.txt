My notes:
Dictionary is a good way to make a menu =)

isinstance()
is a built-in Python function used to determine if an object is an instance of
a specified class or data type.

enumerate()
To print elements and their positions (indexes) from a list, we could use the enumerate() function


list - mutable
tuple - not mutable

Some useful dictionary methods are clear(), copy(), get(), items(), keys(), values()

clear()
This method removes all items from the dictionary, effectively making it empty.
It doesn't return any value; it just modifies the original dictionary in place.

copy():
Creates a shallow copy of the dictionary.
The original dictionary and the copy are separate, but the objects within them are still references to the same objects.

get(key, default=None):
Returns the value associated with the specified key.
If the key is not found, it returns the default value (which is None if not specified).

items():
Returns a view of the dictionary's key-value pairs as tuples.
It can be useful for iterating over the items in the dictionary.
returns a view object that displays a list of tuples containing the key-value pairs of a dictionary.

keys():
Returns a view of the dictionary's keys.
It provides an iterable of the keys in the dictionary.

values():
Returns a view of the dictionary's values. It provides an iterable of the values in the dictionary.
